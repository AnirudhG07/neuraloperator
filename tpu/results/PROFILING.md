# TPU FFT profiling — tpu/traces/ (xprof /device:TPU:0)

## methodology
- capture: `bench_jax.profile()` = `jax.profiler.trace()` around 15 `block_until_ready(fn(x))` per (engine, N).
- device µs = Σ `XLA Ops` event `device_duration_ps` on /device:TPU:0 ÷ runs (on-chip time only, NO host dispatch).
- HBM = `memory_access_breakdown` mem-space-1 bytes ÷ runs.  AI = `flops` ÷ `bytes_accessed`.  category = XLA `hlo_category`.

## verify in TensorBoard (open this trace; each number's source)
| number here | TensorBoard tool → field |
|---|---|
| device µs/run | Trace Viewer → 'XLA Modules' block duration; or Op Profile → total self-time ÷ runs |
| HBM MB/run | Memory Viewer → peak/bytes; or Op Profile → 'Bytes accessed' (HBM), ÷ runs |
| AI (flop/byte) | Op Profile → 'FLOPs' ÷ 'Bytes accessed' |
| MXU/VPU/memops/custom % | Op Profile → group by Category (rolled up from hlo_category) |
| the RAW category rows below | Op Profile → the 'Category' column, ungrouped |
| a single op (fusion.N) | Op Profile → expand a category; or Trace Viewer → click the op |

## summary  (sorted by N;  ★ = fastest device µs at that N;  the engine name is split into who/D/func/method/trick facets;  memops = copy+reshape+transpose+slice+gather+reverse+DMA)

## fresh headline (device time, v5e, jax 0.11.1 — Pallas NOW compiles)

**Fastest USABLE engine per N** (★ in the table is device-time only; see the int8 caveat below):

| N | fastest usable | µs | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 256 | pallas_trickB / reim-bf16 | 4.0 / 6.0 | tiny transform; VMEM kernel + fixed overhead |
| 1024 | **pallas** (VMEM-resident) | **7.8** | whole FFT in ONE fused kernel — no HBM round-trips |
| 4096 | **pallas-bf16** | **23.7** | VMEM-resident + half operand bytes |
| 8192 | **reim-bf16** | **69.0** | pallas OOMs VMEM here; bf16 halves HBM |
| 16384 | **reim-bf16** | **146.8** | same — pallas can't fit, reim-bf16 wins |
| 2D 64²/128²/256² | **partial** | 16.7 / 65 / 392 | FNO low-mode DFT; 5–11× faster than jnp/reim2 |

### Pallas (VMEM-resident) — the Phase-4 lever, now measured
With jax 0.11.1 the Pallas kernels compile on device (they failed on the old 0.6.2). Result: the
whole radix-B FFT runs as **one fused kernel** (100% `custom-call`; HBM shows `—` because the cost
model can't see inside an opaque kernel — intermediates never leave VMEM by design). This makes
**pallas the fastest engine at N=1024 (7.8 µs) and N=4096 (23.7 µs bf16)** — it removes exactly the
inter-stage corner-turn copies that cost reim ~55% of its time. It **OOMs the 16 MB scoped VMEM at
N≥8192**, so above 4096 the streaming `reim-bf16` is the usable champion. This confirms the earlier
prediction: keeping both radix stages VMEM-resident is the real HBM lever.

### ⚠ int8 accuracy caveat (why the raw ★ misleads at 256 / 8192 / 16384)
The table's ★ is **device time only**. `direct-int8` (★ at 256) and `reim-int8` (★ at 8192/16384)
are fast purely because int8 = 1 byte/component (¼ the HBM on a memory-bound transform) — but
**`reim-int8` is numerically DEAD (rel_err ≈ 1.0)**: the naive `.astype(int8)` collapses the DFT
matrix's [-1,1] entries to {-1,0,1}. `direct-int8` (scaled) is ~1e-2 but O(N²) so it only survives
at tiny N. **Discount both**; the fastest *correct* engines are pallas (≤4096) and reim-bf16 (>4096).

## FNO integration (fno_reim.py) — trains on v5e
The reim rfft is wired into a full JAX FNO (`tpu/fno_reim.py`): forward = reim `jax_rfft` (real/imag,
no complex64), keep m low modes, complex channel-mix, inverse = reim-style partial-IDFT matmul.
Spectral-conv matches a jnp.fft reference to 2e-6.  End-to-end training on the v5e (N=256, width 32,
16 modes, 4 layers, 256 samples, 200 epochs): **test rel L2 2.27 → 0.03, test_mse ~1.5e-8, 15.6 s**.
(That wall-time is host-dispatch bound for a model this small, not a paper-scale throughput number —
a 2D Darcy-scale FNO would be the apples-to-apples benchmark.)
